Go (often referred to as Golang[13]) is a programming language designed by Google[14] engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike,

 and Ken Thompson.[11] Go is statically typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, with the added benefits of memory safety,

 garbage collection, structural typing,[5] and CSP-style concurrency.

 [15] The compiler, tools, and source code are all free and open source.[16]
