Go (often referred to as Golang[13]) is a programming language designed by Google[14] engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[11] Go is statically typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, with the added benefits of memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[5] and CSP-style concurrency.
[15] The compiler, tools, and source code are all free and open source.[16]
